# Position-Based Dynamics for Soft Bodies

![Project Visualization](assets/demo.gif)

This project was created for the ETH Zurich course **"252-0546-00L Physically-Based Simulation in Computer Graphics"** during the **HS2024** semester. We have implemented **XPBD (Extended Position-Based Dynamics)** using advanced simulation methods and built it on a modern **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, created from the ground up.

---

## Overview

Our implementation of XPBD is inspired by the following sources:
- The original **["Extended Position Based Dynamics"](https://diglib.eg.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/e057a383-9937-4204-850a-97d851d0eebd/content)**
- **["XPBD: Position-Based Simulation of Compliant Constrained Dynamics"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2994258.2994272)**

The architecture is heavily inspired by:
- The **Homework framework** provided in the course.
- **[Engineering Tool 2021 Git Repository](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/mathiebr/engtool21/-/tree/master)** (partially derived from the same code base).

For geometric mesh-processing, we used a custom fork [libigl](https://libigl.github.io/), which supports **directional shadows** that are camera independent.
- The tool is also written in such a way to make it possible to overide the **vertex** and **fragment** shaders of both dynamic and static objects.

## Features

Our implementation of XPBD supports the following constraints:

1. **Distance Constraint**  
   Enforces a constant distance between two vertices, allowing for robust spring-like behavior.

2. **Tetrahedral Volume Constraint**  
   Preserves the volume of tetrahedral meshes, ensuring realistic deformation of 3D objects.

3. **Shell Volume Constraint**  
   Preserves the volume of non-tetrahedral meshes, using only the face vertices.

4. **Kinematic Friction**  
   Simulates the energy dissipation when two objects slide against each other.

5. **Static Friction**  
   Prevents motion between objects at rest relative to each other, up to a threshold.

6. **Static Collisions**  
   Resolves collisions between objects by preventing interpenetration and maintaining separation.

## How to Build

This project is built using **CMake**. To build the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ucinereo/PBS-soft-body.git
    ```

2. Pull assets using Git LFS:
   ```bash
   git lfs pull
   ```

4. Create a build directory and configure the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

5. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```
